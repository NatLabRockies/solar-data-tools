Solar Data Tools is an open-source Python library for analyzing PV power (and irradiance) time-series data.
It was developed to enable analysis of unlabeled PV data, i.e. with no model, no meteorological data, and no performance
index required, by taking a statistical signal processing approach in the algorithms used in the package’s main data
processing pipeline. Solar Data Tools empowers PV system fleet owners or operators to analyze system performance
a hundred times faster even when they only have access to the most basic data stream—power output of the system.

Solar Data Tools provides methods for data I/O, cleaning, filtering, plotting, and analysis.
These methods are largely automated and require little to no input from the user regardless of system type—from utility
tracking systems to multi-pitch rooftop systems. Get started `here <index_getting_started.md>`_ with installation and basic tutorials!
We also recommend taking a look at `this recent webinar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=XKbqIlAEwOQ>`_ we did
with the DOE's Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) with our colleagues at NREL, where we discuss the motivation behind
the development of Solar Data Tools and demonstrate its capabilities.

Contributions to these documentation pages are welcome (and much appreciated!), and you can find our contribution
guidelines `here <index_dev.md>`__.

the Solar Energy Technologies Office Award Number 38529.
